# Bushfire detection
This is the repository containing all my resources(code+notes) for my honours project: Bushfire detection with Lora.



## firmware setup
It seems that if the micro-python firmware is not installed properly on pico, we can't connect to the pico on Thonny. To install it, just find the firmware [here for pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html), and drag it into pico. In order for pico to appear as a storage device, you have to hold the `bootsel` button while you are plugging in the usb.





## todo
